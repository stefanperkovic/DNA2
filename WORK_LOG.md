| October 10 | 10:50 - 11:50  | Discussed with people in the class on different possible solutions to the problem set. The main goal was to find an algorithm that is not running in O(n) time and preferably one in something shorter like log(n). We discussed bitwise operators and trying to map each character to bitwise number and then shifting over them. I also though about potentially doing it a tree with the depth of the tree being the length of the section we are looking for and no deeper. Then I could try and figure out how to make lookups more efficient, but that is my struggle with the algorithm at the moment. |
| October 14 |  8:50 - 9:50   |                                                                      Continued discussing with my table group on how to solve. We have closed in on representing the sequence as a number specifically two bits like 00 for A 01 for C 10 for T and 11 for G. Store these in an int and as we go through the sequence we shift over each time so that we don't have to recalculate the whole sequence each time. We also need to be careful at times when shifting after detecting a sequence to not cut off another potential sequence so we may have to double check. Started working on trying to code it. |
| October 14 |  10:40-11:10   |                                                                                                                                                                                       Worked on going through the STR and mapping it to a number. Created a map of length for where I can easily get the two bit number associated with each letter value. Then I looped through the STR to have the number that we are going to search for in our sequence. I also got the number representing the first characters of STR.length in the text so that we have an easy place to start checking for sequences. |
| October 14 | 11:10 - 11:40  |                                                                                                                                                         Decided to change from looping through the first STR characters outside of the main for-loop to inside. This is because whenever we don't find the instance we are going to want to shift STR characters over to the right so it makes sense to do it inside. I also created a while loop so that when STR = the current set of 8, then we will look for the next one in that same while loop while adding to current count until it no longer equals |

Calculated both the STR and the first characters of STR.length outside the for-loop in order to make it easy to start with our comparisons and not have to do them in the for-loop. Also deleted my map as it isn't neccesary in the new algorithm Delete the while loop as I will work on implementing window shifting inside the for-loop instead. |

Still getting the wrong solution when trying to run the code. I also for some reason was having an index-out of bounds error with i < str.length() which I need to find out why and fix. Created a loop to calculate the base to the power of the string.length -1 outside of the main for-loop so I dont have to do it everytime. |
| October 23 |  9:00 - 9:50   |                                                                                                                                                             I am getting an error where I am returning the wrong number normally it is just one or for one case I am only 10 off the original. I don't understand what is wrong with the code I have been looking through it for the whole class. I changed the loop cases so that I got until less that sequence.length() so I dont get an index out of bounds error. I also had a mistake where I was looking at STR.length() instead of sequence.length(). |
| October 29 |  9:30 - 10:05  |                                                                                                                                         I am still having problems with my code though I think I am on the right track now. I realized that I was shifting over by one using window shifting even when I had found a match. When I find a match I should instead shift over by the whole str.legnth() to see if the next time it pops up I am at a new match. I also have created an inner while loop so that when if finds a match it keeps shifting over by str.length() chunks until it no longer matches. |
| October 29 | 10:15 - 10:55  |                                                                                                                                                                                Changed my for loop to a while loop that way it was easier to change i depending on if we were matching STR'S or not. By doing this I could get rid of the temp variables that I was using and just use the real ones. I am stiling having an index out of bonds error for the largest case that I can't solve. I also just created a another variable j for the nested for loop as it was just easier to understand that way. |
| October 29 | 11:00 - 11:30  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Realized that I could fix my indexoutofbonds error by just checking to make sure i was under the sequence.length() in my nested while-loop. After that I added comments. Then I realized I could create separate function for calculating STR hash value of a given length as I was doing it three times throughout my code already. |
