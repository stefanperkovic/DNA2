| October 10 | 10:50 - 11:50 | Discussed with people in the class on different possible solutions to the problem set. The main goal was to find an algorithm that is not running in O(n) time and preferably one in something shorter like log(n). We discussed bitwise operators and trying to map each character to bitwise number and then shifting over them. I also though about potentially doing it a tree with the depth of the tree being the length of the section we are looking for and no deeper. Then I could try and figure out how to make lookups more efficient, but that is my struggle with the algorithm at the moment. |

We have closed in on representing the sequence as a number specifically two bits like 00 for A 01 for C 10 for T and 11 for G. Store these in an int and as we go through the sequence we shift over each time so that we don't have to recalculate the whole sequence each time. We also need to be careful at times when shifting after detecting a sequence to not cut off another potential sequence so we may have to double check. Started working on trying to code it. |
